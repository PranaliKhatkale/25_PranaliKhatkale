19:-
a)if number is 3 the output will be:
second string
third string


b)3>=0,so execution progresses to the second if statement. The second if statement's test fails because 3 not equal to 0. 
Thus, the else block executes. Thus, second string is displayed. The final println is completely outside of any if statement, 
so it always gets executed, and thus third string is always displayed.

c)
if(aNumber >= 0){
            if(aNumber==0)
                  System.out.println("first string"); //indentations to identify code snippet clearly
            else
                  System.out.println("second string");
            System.out.println("third string");
   }
d) 
if(aNumber >= 0){
            if(aNumber==0){
                System.out.println("first string");
            }
            else{
                System.out.println("second string");
            }
            System.out.println("third string");
        }

1) The most basic control flow statement supported by java programming is the if statement.

2) The switch statement allows for any number of possible execution paths.

3) The do while statement is similar to the while statement , but evaluates its expression at the end of the loop.

4) We can write infite loop using for  statement by leaving 3 conditions of for loop empty. 
     for(; ; ){
            System.out.println("Infinite");
        }

5) We can write infite loop using while statement by giving true in while loop condition.
   while(true)
  {
        System.out.println("Infinite");
  }
